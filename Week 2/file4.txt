A young child sits on the floor, surrounded by a scattered collection of crayons and half-finished drawings. Each scribble and color represents a world of imagination that only the child can see. She hums softly, entirely immersed in her art, oblivious to the world around her. Her mother watches from a distance, smiling at the innocence and creativity on display. Childhood, fleeting yet profound, is captured in these simple, magical moments.
