The small, seaside village lay quiet under the morning sun, with fishing boats bobbing gently in the harbor. The waves lapped against the shore, their rhythm steady and soothing. Seagulls called out to each other as they glided over the water, searching for their morning meal. Fishermen prepared their nets, exchanging stories of past hauls and near-misses. Life here moved slowly, a peaceful contrast to the bustling cities miles away.
